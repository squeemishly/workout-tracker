- Follow the setup instructions for the backend to get it up and running

git clone this repo

## Stack
This login form has been brought to you by React.js.
The backend was written and developed in Node.js and Express. You can find out more about it [here](https://github.com/squeemishly/workout-tracker-api).


## Features!
Have you seen that sweet, sweet login form? Because seriously, that is some sweet coding action.
After you login, currently, you have to manually visit /profile to see your profile. Once you do though, WOOOO-EEEEE!!! There's a ridiculously awesome See All Workouts button!!! Click that button, and you've got a list of workouts.
Ready for some magic? Because if you click that very appropriately named Click to View Lifts link, you'll get to see any lifts added to a workout. Neat!
How do you add lifts to a workout? How do you even make a workout? Hold your ruddy horses there my friend. I haven't gotten that far yet... Look to the coming attractions section of this loquacious README.
